data.py creates an input file to be used for gold-basic.c or gold.c
gold-basic.c functionally executes a convolutional layer
gold.c does the same as gold-basic.c, except it allows for a variable number of neuron bits to be processed
clc.cu attempts to showcase how new hardware with a new instruction could bit-serially compute convolutional layers
